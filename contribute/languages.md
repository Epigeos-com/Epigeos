# How not to contribute
Please do not:
1. contribute to translations unless you actually speak the language
2. contribute to assets without contacting me first
3. change anything other than things that should be translated, all language versions should be the same, just translated
4. change file names, standardisation over understanding

# How to contribute
Simply copy the 'en' folder and start translating the html and js files

If you have no experience in html and js, it may be helpful to know you should only translate stuff between the > and < in html and only stuff in quotes in js
